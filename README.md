# Forward and Inverse Calderon Problem Solver

This project involves solving the forward and inverse Calderon problem using deep learning techniques implemented with the DeepXDE library in Python. The forward problem involves predicting the solution to the Calderon problem given certain input parameters, while the inverse problem involves determining the unknown coefficients in the problem based on observed data.

## Overview

The project utilizes deep learning models to solve both the forward and inverse Calderon problems. It leverages the DeepXDE library, built on top of TensorFlow, for implementing and training the models. The forward problem is solved by training a model to predict the solution given input parameters, while the inverse problem involves training a model to estimate the unknown coefficients based on observed data.

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following libraries:

- `deepxde`: A Python library for solving differential equations using deep learning techniques.
- `tensorflow`: An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
- `numpy`: A library for numerical computing in Python.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.
- `seaborn`: A data visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- `csv`: A module for reading and writing CSV files in Python.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install deepxde tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
